# Vision-LLM Alignemnt Training (SFT+PPO/DPO)
Vision-LLM-Alignment is a project designed to implement alignment training for visual large language models (LLMs).
This includes SFT training, reward model training, and PPO/DPO training.
If additional alignment algorithms need to be supported, please raise them in an issue.

## Changelog
- [2024/07/18] We provide large-scale vision feedback data. It is a combination of the following high-quality vision feedback datasets. The dataset can be found in [wangclnlp/vision-feedback-mix-binarized](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wangclnlp/vision-feedback-mix-binarized) and [wangclnlp/vision-feedback-mix-binarized-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wangclnlp/vision-feedback-mix-binarized-cleaned).
- [2024/07/10] We support the direct loading of a LLaVA model in all training stages, including SFT training, RM training, and PPO/DPO training.
- [2024/07/07] We support the direct loading of a LLaVA model during the SFT training phase. You just need to set the `model_architecture` parameter to "llava" and specify the LLaVA model path with `from_checkpoint`. Support for this functionality during the DPO, RM training, and PPO junction phases will be introduced soon.

## Installation
You can use anaconda/miniconda to install packages needed for this project.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preparing Models and Datasets
### Models
Vision-LLM requires both a vision encoder and a language model.
Its architecture is depicted in the [figure](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples/blob/master/applications/DeepSpeed-VisualChat/assets/model.png).

### Datasets
We have tentatively implemented all alignment training based on this LLaVA dataset format. 
Some samples can be found in the [data folder](https://github.com/wangclnlp/Vision-LLM-Alignment/tree/master/data).

## Training Models
### Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)
```Shell
bash run_sft.sh 
```

### Reward Model Training
```Shell
bash run_rm_training.sh
```
### Direct Pereference Optimization (DPO)
```Shell
bash run_dpo_training.sh
```
### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
```Shell
bash run_ppo_training.sh
```
### Evaluation
```Shell
bash run_predict.sh 
```

## Supported Models
| LLM | Model size |
|:---:|:---:|
| LLaMA-2 | 7B/13B/70B |
| LLaMA-3 | 8B/70B |

| Vision Model |
|:---:|
| clip-vit-large-patch14 |
| clip-vit-large-patch14-336 |

Note: Other LLMs with the same architecture as LLaMA-2/3 are also supported. You can also add arbitrary model architectures by modifying this `training/utils/model/build_model.py`.
