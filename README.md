# Vision-LLM Alignemnt Training (SFT+PPO/DPO)
Vision-LLM-Alignment aims to implement alignment training for visual large language models (LLMs), encompassing SFT training, reward model training, and PPO/DPO training. 
For the integration of additional alignment algorithms or to report any arising bugs, please submit an issue.


## Changelog
- [2024/10/03] We support tuning for multi-image instructions on the [LLaMA-3.2-Vision](https://huggingface.co/collections/meta-llama/llama-32-66f448ffc8c32f949b04c8cf). 
See data [examples](data/sft_samples_multi_image.json) for usage.

- [2024/09/28] 💡We support for training the [LLaMA-3.2-Vision](https://huggingface.co/collections/meta-llama/llama-32-66f448ffc8c32f949b04c8cf). You just need to set the `model_architecture` and `template` parameters to "llama-3.2-vision", and specify the LLaMA-Vision model path with `from_checkpoint`.

- [2024/08/21] 💪We released __RoVRM:A Robust Visual Reward Model Optimized via Auxiliary Textual Preference Data__, which is trained and applied for human-alignment training based on this repository.[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12109)][[Checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/wangclnlp/robust_visual_reward_model)]

- [2024/08/19] We support for training the [LLaVA-NeXT](https://huggingface.co/collections/llava-hf/llava-next-65f75c4afac77fd37dbbe6cf) (as known as LLaVA-1.6). You just need to set the `model_architecture` parameter to "llava_next", and specify the LLaVA-NeXT model path with `from_checkpoint`.

- [2024/07/18] We provide a large-scale vision feedback dataset. It is a combination of the following high-quality vision feedback datasets. The dataset can be found in [wangclnlp/vision-feedback-mix-binarized](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wangclnlp/vision-feedback-mix-binarized) and [wangclnlp/vision-feedback-mix-binarized-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wangclnlp/vision-feedback-mix-binarized-cleaned).

- [2024/07/10] We support the direct loading of a LLaVA model in all training stages, including SFT training, RM training, and PPO/DPO training.

- [2024/07/07] We support the direct loading of a LLaVA model during the SFT training phase. You just need to set the `model_architecture` parameter to "llava" and specify the LLaVA model path with `from_checkpoint`. Support for this functionality during the DPO, RM training, and PPO junction phases will be introduced soon.

## Benchmark
During the development of this system, we conducted a series of benchmark tests to evaluate and validate the system's performance. Specifically, we selected RLAIF-V as the preference dataset and LLaVA-Instruct-150K as the input instruction for the RLHF training session. In the model evaluation phase, we utilized several standard benchmarks, including MMHalBench, Object HalBench, AMBER, LLaVA-Benchmark, and MMinstruct, to conduct a more comprehensive assessment of the differences in trustworthiness and helpfulness of the vision-based LLM before and after alignment.

For training the reward model, we used the LLaVA-1.5-7B model. We performed Best-of-n sampling and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) alignment training on two models: LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The benchmarking results of the system are detailed in the figure below.

In addition, we conducted DPO training for this system, specifically targeting the LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B models. 
The results are detailed in the following figure.

## Installation
You can use anaconda/miniconda to install packages needed for this project.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preparing Models and Datasets
### Models
Vision-LLM requires both a vision encoder and a language model.
Its architecture is depicted in the [figure](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples/blob/master/applications/DeepSpeed-VisualChat/assets/model.png).
You can also directly employ a vision LLM after SFT, such as LLaVA-1.5/-NeXT and LLaMA-3.2-Vision-Instruction, as the actor model.



### Datasets
We have tentatively implemented all alignment training based on this LLaVA dataset format. 
Some samples can be found in the [data folder](data/).
