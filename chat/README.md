We provide a CLI interface for uses to test their trained chat model. First of all, please note that you need to provide both the trained checkpoint and the original language model & vision encoder paths. The model is first initialized and then loads the trained checkpoint. Also, please note that if you used multi-modal causal attention during your training, remember to put --enable_mmca_attention for in your chat script.
